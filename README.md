## Embedded Systems Project Report:

## 1. Introduction
This document provides the detailed design for the AVR Mini Project implementing UART communication and Digital I/O (DIO) control on an ATmega328P microcontroller.
The system allows the user to send and receive serial commands via UART to control an LED and to monitor the state of a push button.
It demonstrates register-level C programming using direct access to MCU registers without Arduino libraries.
